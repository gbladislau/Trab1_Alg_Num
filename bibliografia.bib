    abstract = {The induction motor is the most popular motor in energy conversion and industrial drive systems. This popularity is due to its robustness, low cost, and easy maintenance. Electrical, mechanical, thermal, magnetic and environmental stresses cause faults in the induction motor during the operation process. One of the challenging topics for many researchers is the development of a reliable efficient induction motor fault diagnostic techniques. The broken rotor bar fault is one of the critical faults that need to be early detected due to its sudden severe damages. The objective of this study is to present a survey of existing broken rotor bar fault detection techniques with new classification based on fault signature. Various monitoring conditions and signal processing techniques are considered for the detection process. A comprehensive list of references is reported for each fault signature and classified based on (i) loading level, (ii) the number of broken bars, (iii) validation and (vi) signal processing.},

%address
                %Usually the address of the publisher or other type of institution.
%annote
                %An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography.
%author
                %The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the LaTeX book.
%booktitle
                %Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the LaTeX book for how to type titles. For book entries, use the title field instead.
%chapter
                %A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
%crossref
                %The database key of the entry being cross referenced. Any fields that are missing from the current record are inherited from the field being cross referenced.
%edition
                %The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''. This should be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
%editor
                %Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book. If there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears.
%howpublished
                %How something strange has been published. The first word should be capitalized.
%institution
                %The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
%journal
                %A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals.
%key
                %Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when the ``author'' information is missing. This field should not be confused with the key that appears in the cite command and at the beginning of the database entry.
%month
                %The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the LaTeX book.
%note
                %Any additional information that can help the reader. The first word should be capitalized.
%number
                %The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are given numbers in a named series.
%organization
                %The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a manual.
%pages
                %One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42--111 or 7,41,73--97 or 43+(the `+' in this last example indicates pages following that don't form a simple range). To make it easier to maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TeX to denote number ranges (as in 7--33).
